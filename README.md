### Problem Statement
The problem we are addressing is the inability to monitor and predict future health issues in a proactive manner. Traditional healthcare systems rely heavily on reactive measures, with individuals seeking medical attention only after symptoms have already presented themselves. This approach can be costly and ineffective, especially when dealing with chronic diseases that require ongoing management.

The smart shirt we are designing aims to address this issue by providing individuals with real-time health data that can be used to predict and prevent future health issues. This technology has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by promoting a more proactive approach to health management. The impact on the community can be significant, with individuals empowered to take control of their health and make more informed decisions about their lifestyle choices. By identifying potential health issues early on, this technology can help reduce healthcare costs and improve overall health outcomes.
